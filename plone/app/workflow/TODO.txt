plone.app.workflow to-do
========================

 Reader/editor roles:
 
    - Add Reader and Editor roles during portal creation, migration
    - Grant "View" to Reader and "Modify portal content" to editor at site root
    
    The sharing page can then be used to assign these (they will be explicitly
    allowed for anyone with Modify portal content), and they should work for
    most workflows without needing explicit support (permission settings can 
    be acquired).

 Sharing page:
   
    - Wire up view to template
        - need to use :list and :record form elements to send selections
    - Write update() method which performs the actual updates on form submit
    
    - KSS enable finding, adding and changing settings for users/groups
        - can hide the submit buttons in <noscript> tags in that case
    
    - Enable settings for the Anonymous user (aka "Everyone")
    - Enable settings for the "Logged in" pseudo-user
        - note, this is not necessarily easy, because it implies messing with 
          permissions rather than granting local roles!
          
    - Need to restrict actual roles managed to a meaningful subset and give
      proper titles (hard coded for now)
      
    - Final merge steps:
        -> Modify ATCT to let the 'sharing' alias point to @@sharing
        -> Deprecate folder_localrole_form
        -> Add alias for folder_localrole_form -> @@sharing or use a redirect
