plone.app.workflow to-do
========================

 Sharing page:
 
    - KSS-enable finding, adding and changing settings for users/groups
        - can hide the submit buttons in <noscript> tags in that case
    
    - Enable settings for the Anonymous user (aka "Everyone")
    - Enable settings for the "Logged in" pseudo-user
        - note, this is not necessarily easy, because there is no user for
          this; it may be possible to make "all users" pseudo-group using
          PAS.
          
    - May want to be selective about who can manage assign which roles
    - May want Manager to be able to manage all roles?
      
    - Final merge steps:
        -> Modify ATCT to let the 'sharing' alias point to @@sharing
        -> Deprecate folder_localrole_form
        -> Add alias for folder_localrole_form -> @@sharing or use a redirect
