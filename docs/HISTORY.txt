Changelog
=========

1.1.1 - UNRELEASED
------------------

  and register them with Zope on startup so you can manage them via the
  ZMI or a GenericSetup profile.

1.1.0 - April 21, 2008
----------------------

1.0.7 - March 9, 2008
---------------------

- Created fine-grained permissions for delegating sharing page roles in
  order to avoid people with a delegated permission escalating their own
  privileges. This can now be controlled at a high level by the
  "Sharing page: Delegate roles" permission, which controls access to the
  Sharing page machinery, and at an individual roles basis, with 
  permissions like "Sharing page: Delegate Editor role".

  to edit their own roles.

- Added friendly "Changes saved" message.
